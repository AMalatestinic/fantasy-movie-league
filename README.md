## Overview

Fantasy Movie League is a web app inspired by fantasy sports leagues — but for movies. Users can create leagues, draft movies onto their teams, and compete based on box office performance. It brings a competitive, gamified spin to movie releases.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- React
  – Component-based UI
- Next.js
  – API routes & server-side rendering
- MongoDB
  – Database for leagues, users, and movies
- Custom draft logic (team size limits, no duplicate movies per league)

### What I Learned

- Design Next.js API routes that interact seamlessly with a MongoDB backend
- Structure a full-stack app using React for frontend and Next.js backend in one cohesive project
